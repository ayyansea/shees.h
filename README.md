# shees.h - when it do be like that

Unleash your inner zoomer by including this to your code.

I don't know shit about C's preprocessor so proceed with caution.

# Example

```c
#include "shees.h"
#include "stdio.h"

mf main() goes
    based mf life be 42 rn
    
    longass mf a be 1 rn
    longass mf look b be at a rn

    simp ch be 's' rn
    hypothetically (ch) goes
        maybe 'a':
            printf("a\n") rn
            damn rn
        maybe 'b':
            printf("b\n") rn
            damn rn
        whatever:
            printf("whatever\n") rn
            damn rn
    kinda

    (life > a) actually (a be a + life) tho (a be life) rn

    printf("%d\n", look b) rn
    printf("%d\n", life) rn
    deadass 0 rn
kinda
```
